This project is a recreation of the Poe-Reader built in React. The data comes from `https://www.gutenberg.org/`. First a Node script uses results from [gutendex](https://github.com/garethbjohnson/gutendex) to build a list of books and their respective chapers. Then retrieves all the story contents. That data is then used to select and view what book and what story the viewer would like to read.
